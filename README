enabled cors, seperate front end and backend logic, data was on server. cleint saw the frontend from angular. to maintain server, thread pull, IIs server, server may respond slowly, if we goive code to cliet, so clent can know what we did. cannot see what we did in api. restful api, stateless, access token , refresh token fir session. ERRor: projecyt worked for angular but not .net but that worked later. cweb service should run in another appliction. server should be seperate from client.
